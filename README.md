LearnCircle is an open source platform with the goal of taking free education to the remotest areas of the world using the power of internet, technology and volunteer educators from around the globe.

Applications like Facebook and WhatsApp are being used by people in remote places for social sharing, news and connecting with the world.
Taking the clues from the success of these big apps, LearnCircle aims to be a tool to connect, those in need of better education with empathic and enthusiast educators who believe in free, accesible, quality education for all.

LearnCircle is currently in early stages of development and is expected to have a beta launch in Oct 2017.
